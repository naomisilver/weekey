**WeeKey** is a macro pad with both onboard memory capabilities and fully featured control software. It uses hand soldered, regular keyboard switches and a Raspberry Pi Pico (or similar MCU) as the controller. It relies on the F13-F21 keys for input as they're unassigned in most modern software and free for the taking.

> while I have version controlled STLs hosted here, I would prefer you download them [printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/1415910-weekey-9k) so I can get my reward points :P

## Features
- Fully custom 3D printed enclosure
- USB HID input handling via a Raspberry Pi Pico (or similar) with the `usb_hid` adafruit library
- Either onboard action assignment on the MCU **or** using WeeKey Control
- Hotswap angled spacer design allowing for fine tuning to the user's liking

## Future

While I made this project because I didn't want to buy a stream deck and is where *I* want this. I won't entirely be shelving this project. Some potential future plans consist of:
- Creating a 12K version using a key matrix as apposed to direct wire as used on the 9K version
- Updating the firmware and control software to use a custom HID report descriptor to be able to send more than the existing 12 F keys. (this isn't off the table, I made a custom HID descriptor for my previous project, [The Novostok](https://github.com/naomisilver/novostok))
- Making magnetically attaching 'addons' that could add displays, midi controls, rotary dials etc...
- Making the existing control software platform agnostic, the firmware is by default but I rely on windows specific media controls for example. Without a Mac device this may prove difficult.
